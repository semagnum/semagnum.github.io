Welcome! You found my personal GitHub website.

## Blender

Within Blender, I create art as well as develop tools. You can find my art at [spencermagnusson.artstation.com](https://spencermagnusson.artstation.com) and my tools on [my GitHub](https://github.com/semagnum). Be sure to check out my Blender add-ons (including but not limited to):

- **[Light Painter](/light-painter/)** - "turns light design in Blender on its head: instead of manipulating the lights, you indicate how you want them to appear on your models by painting their influence. Very cool and innovative!" - Blender Nation
- **[Shot Matcher](/shot-matcher/)** - "Shot Matcher does a great job in helping you quickly set your brights and darks, which is essential in visual effects compositing. A simple to use, very handy tool!" - Sean Kennedy
- **[nView Live](/nview-live/)** - toggles an objectâ€™s visibility in the viewport in realtime. The main focus is to improve viewport performance in solid view.
- **[BLint](/blint/)** - automate standardization and file conventions on the Blender projects.

## Optimization and Algorithms

I love problem solving, tool making, and finding optimal methods. These are demonstrated in some of my other public repositories:

- [prime-tester](https://github.com/semagnum/prime-tester) - two simple existing algorithms for solving prime numbers
- [boggle-solver](https://github.com/semagnum/boggle-solver) - give a Boggle table and a dictionary, it will return all viable words!
- [wordle_solver](https://github.com/semagnum/wordle_solver) - a Wordle assistant to help find all remaining possible words based on your guesses and results.
- [markdown-resume-builder](https://github.com/semagnum/markdown-resume-builder) - based on [markdown-resume](https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume), I added functionality to support the notion: one resume, multiple deployments (of resumes, that is). Add tags to build different versions of your resumes to simplify and merge versioning for different resumes.
