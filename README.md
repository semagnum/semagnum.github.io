Hello, welcome to my page!

## Blender

Within Blender, I create art as well as develop tools, some of which I [sell online](https://blendermarket.com/products/nview-v3?ref=2870). You can find my art at [portfolio.pixelfed.social/smagnusson](https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/smagnusson), but my free tools live here, including:

- **[Light Painter](/light-painter/)** - "turns light design in Blender on its head: instead of manipulating the lights, you indicate how you want them to appear on your models by painting their influence. Very cool and innovative!" - Blender Nation
- **[Scene Complexity](https://github.com/semagnum/blender-scene-complexity)** - convenience add-on that retrieves scene statistics to better understand geometry and node tree complexity.
- **[BLint](/blint/)** - automate standardization and file conventions on the Blender projects.

## Optimization and Algorithms

I love problem solving, tool making, and finding optimal methods. These are demonstrated in some of my other public repositories:

- [Prime Tester](https://github.com/semagnum/prime-tester) - two simple existing algorithms for solving prime numbers
- [Boggle Solver](https://github.com/semagnum/boggle-solver) - give a Boggle table and a dictionary, it will return all viable words!
- [Wordle Solver](https://github.com/semagnum/wordle_solver) - a Wordle assistant to help find all remaining possible words based on your guesses and results.
- [markdown-resume-builder](https://github.com/semagnum/markdown-resume-builder) - based on [markdown-resume](https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume), I added functionality to support the notion: one codebase, multiple deployments (of resumes, that is). Add tags to build different versions of your resumes, allowing you to have one base CV that can build multiple resumes catered for different fields and specialties!
